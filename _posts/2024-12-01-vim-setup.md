I really wanted to fully learn Vim and be able to use it comfortably. I guess its time. On my way for setting it up I'll leave here notes how and where.

## Setup
So, first of all, I had to install python3 support for Autocomplete to work first:
```bash
sudo apt install vim-gtk3
```

Next, I configured a few plugins ChatGPT suggested. Each plugin adds some functionality to the Vim.
To use install and use those plugins, here is what I did:
```bash
curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```

Then I edited config file. It is a place where you specify which plugins you want to install and use. So mine config file `~/.vimrc` looks something like this:
```
call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')

" Place plugins here, e.g.:
Plug 'sheerun/vim-polyglot'
Plug 'junegunn/fzf', { 'do': { -> fzf#install() } }
Plug 'junegunn/fzf.vim'

Plug 'preservim/nerdtree'
Plug 'vim-airline/vim-airline'
Plug 'tpope/vim-fugitive'
Plug 'neoclide/coc.nvim', {'branch': 'release'}

Plug 'tpope/vim-surround'
Plug 'Chiel92/vim-autoformat'
let g:formatdef_python = '"black --quiet -"'
let g:formatters_python = ['python']
" autocmd BufWritePre * :Autoformat

" Making it pretty XD
Plug 'joshdick/onedark.vim'
Plug 'ryanoasis/vim-devicons'

call plug#end()
syntax enable
colorscheme onedark
```

For icons to display I had to download and install font: [nerd-fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases)

By the way, while looking for Vim plugins, I stumbled upon this website: [vimawesome.com](https://vimawesome.com)
