## Chomsky Hierarchy of Formal Languages
**Type 0 - Recursively Enumerable Languages** \
Automaton: Turing Machine \
Rules: No restrictions on grammar (can be any computational process). \
Example: Any computable function, including complex languages like natural languages.

**Type 1 - Context-Sensitive Languages** \
Automaton: Linear Bounded Automaton (LBA) (Turing Machine with limited tape)

**Type 2 - Context-Free Languages (CFL)** \
Automaton: Pushdown Automaton (PDA)

**Type 3 - Regular Languages** \
Automaton: Finite Automaton (FA) / Regular Expressions \
Example: Binary strings with an even number of 0s, identifiers in programming languages

## Context-Free Grammar (CFG)
A context-free grammar (CFG) is a way to describe context-free languages (CFLs), which are exactly the languages recognized by Nondeterministic Pushdown Automata (NPDAs).

A grammar is a 4-tuple:
$$ G = (N, T, P, S), $$
where:
- N - non-terminal symbols (variables)
- T - terminal symbols (actual symbols in the language)
- P - production rules ($A \implies \alpha$, where $A$ is a non-terminal and $alpha$ is a string of terminals and/or non-terminals)
- S - start symbol (the derivation begins here)

## Pushdown Automaton (PDA)
A Pushdown Automaton (PDA) is a finite state machine with a stack for additional memory. There are two types:
- Deterministic Pushdown Automaton (DPDA)
- Nondeterministic Pushdown Automaton (NPDA)

PDA is defined as a 7-tuple: \
$$
M = (Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, Z_0, F),
$$
where:
- $Q$ - Set of states
- $\Sigma$ - Input alphabet
- $\Gamma$ - Stack alphabet
- $\delta$ - Transition function
- $q_0$ - Start state
- $Z_0$ - Initial stack symbol
- $F$ - Set of accepting states

<hr>

**Transition function**
$\delta(q, a, X) = (q', \gamma)$, where:
- $q$ is current state
- $a$ is whats left of input
- $X$ is a stack

Deterministic Pushdown Automaton (DPDA):
- $\delta(q, a, X)$ has at most one possible transition

Nondeterministic Pushdown Automaton (NPDA): 
- $\delta(q, a, X) = \{(q_1, \gamma_1), (q_2, \gamma_2), \dots\}$
- Can have multiple possible transitions and $\epsilon$-moves
