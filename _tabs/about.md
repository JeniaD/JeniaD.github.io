## Welcome to my corner of the web ✨

I’m Yevhenii — or Eugene, if you prefer. Born in Ukraine, now a student of computer science and a relentless explorer of cybersecurity. I’m drawn to the unknown, to systems that beg to be unraveled and rebuilt, to problems that demand solutions only the bold would attempt.

I’ve wielded Python, C++, and JavaScript, and occasionally flirted with PHP and C# when the mood struck.

This blog is my workspace, my notebook, and sometimes my playground. It’s where I share what I’ve learned, break down things that fascinate me, and occasionally try something bold. If you’re here, maybe you’re the curious kind too. Stick around—we might just learn something together.
