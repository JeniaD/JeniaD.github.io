Welcome to my blog! My name is Yevhenii (also Eugene, or Jenia for short). I am passionate about cybersecurity and created this site to share my knowledge and make it accessible to anyone all around the world.

### About me
I was born in Ukraine and am currently studying computer science at university. In IT, I am particularly interested in Linux, Python, and web development, in addition to cybersecurity. I have a knowledge base in languages such as Python, C++, JavaScript, and some basic PHP and C#.

Regarding web technologies, I have experience with Python Flask, which I believe is an amazing framework for developing web apps.
