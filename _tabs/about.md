## Welcome to my corner of the web ✨

I’m Yevhenii, or Eugene, if you prefer. Born in Ukraine, shaped by curiosity, and now on a never-ending quest to understand, create, and sometimes dismantle the systems that power our world.

I’m a student of computer science by title, but a lifelong student of everything unconventional by nature. Cybersecurity is my passion. I’m not here to just understand how systems work; I’m here to discover how they break and how they can evolve.

My toolbox is eclectic: Python for clarity, C++ for power, and occasional flirtations with PHP and C#, because sometimes, chaos inspires innovation. I enjoy building things that shouldn’t work as well as they do and dismantling ideas to see what holds them together.

This blog is my workspace, my notebook, and sometimes my playground. It’s where I share what I’ve learned, break down things that fascinate me, and occasionally try something bold. If you’re here, maybe you’re the curious kind too. Stick around — we might just learn something together.
