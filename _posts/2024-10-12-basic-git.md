Git is a powerful and widely-used version control system that helps developers track changes in their code and collaborate efficiently with others. Here’s a guide to some of the most essential Git commands for beginners to get started.

## Setup and Configuration

Before you start using Git, it’s important to configure your identity. This is necessary for proper version control and collaboration.

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

Verify:
```bash
git config --list
```

## Initializing a Repository

```bash
git init
```
This creates a hidden `.git` folder which contains all the data Git needs to track changes

## Cloning a Repository

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

## Checking Repository Status

The `git status` command shows the current state of your working directory and staging area, displaying changes that are staged, unstaged, or untracked

```bash
git status
```

## Staging Changes

```bash
git add <file_name>

git add .
```

## Committing Changes

```bash
git commit -m "commit message"
```

## Viewing Commit History

```bash
git log
```

## Branching

Branches allow you to work on new features or experiments without affecting the main project. To create and switch to a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b <branch_name>
```

You can also switch between branches using
```bash
git checkout <branch_name>
```

You can also switch between branches using
```bash
git branch
```

## Merging Branches

```bash
git checkout main
git merge <branch_name>
```

## Pushing Changes to a Remote Repository

```bash
git push origin <branch_name>
```

## Pulling Updates from a Remote Repository

```bash
git pull
```
