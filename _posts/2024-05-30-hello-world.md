Hello there, this is my first post!

My name is Yevhenii (you can call me Eugene, though).

I hope to make this blog a great place to store various information, mostly about cybersecurity. As I am planning to advance in my penetration testing career, I wanted to create an online space where I could share my thoughts, experiences, and cheat sheets regarding computer science.

It could also be a useful place for learning something new. I doubt, however, that I would make good enough content for someone to actually study it.

I don't know yet if this blog will take off or even be visible by search engines, as I haven't had much free time lately to post here regularly. Still, whoever you are, if you want to contact me, feel free to reach out through the social media links listed in the lower-left menu.
