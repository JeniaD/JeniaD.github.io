Welcome!
I’m Yevhenii – though you might also know me as Eugene, or just Jenia. I’m passionate about cybersecurity and created this blog to share my knowledge with anyone interested in learning more about the world of tech.

### About me
I was born in Ukraine and I’m currently studying computer science at university. My main interests include Linux, Python, and web development, with a strong focus on cybersecurity.

In terms of programming, I’ve worked with Python, C++, JavaScript, and I have some experience with PHP and C#. For web development, I’ve enjoyed using Python Flask – it’s a great framework that makes building web apps both fun and efficient.

Feel free to explore the blog and dive into the content. I’m always learning, and I hope this space can help others do the same!
